          <h1>The Dirt Whispered</h1>
          <h2>By Rise Against</h2>
          <p>She got down on hands and knees,
One ear against the ground, <br />
Holding her breath to hear something,
But the dirt made not a sound tonight <br />
            Echoes of songs still lurk on distant foreign shores <br />
            Where we danced just to please the gods that only ask for more,
So it goes <br />
But still we give ourselves to this <br />
We can't spend our lives waiting to live<br />
On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But the daylight
Isn't what she wants <br />
The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip</p>
