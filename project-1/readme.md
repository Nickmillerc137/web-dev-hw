**Intro**

When I first joined this class i can say that i really did not know what i was getting myself into. I really did not realize that the class would be so much about codes and the process of how the internet works. All in all, I have had a lot of fun learning about these topics and I'm excisted to learn more.


**Issues**

A few difficulties i ran into while typing were that my screen looks a little different from the tutorial pictures as all of my text are `in white and the page is black`. Also when I am typing my lists i have to put a space in between so that they are not side by side.

*Inline Code*
